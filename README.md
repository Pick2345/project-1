Predictive analytics for stock market trends often involves using historical data to forecast future stock prices. Here's a simple yet functional Python script using machine learning (specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks) to predict stock prices based on historical trends.

We'll use:

yfinance to fetch historical data

pandas and numpy for data manipulation

scikit-learn for preprocessing

TensorFlow/Keras for building the LSTM model

matplotlib for visualization
